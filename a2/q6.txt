For these results, it's expected since for a search using a non rtree index structure, we expect
that the database will go through every single record irregardless of the size of l

However for the rtree index search, the nodes visited would depend on the size of l as we can see from our table of results. So as expected, this time increases with the increased value of l since it would mean more records would meet the condition.
