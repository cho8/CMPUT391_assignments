CREATE INDEX subpred_index ON rdf(sub, pred);

/*
We would need indexes on the predicate at the very least. Since we are using
one table to store subject, predicate, and objects, multiple objects in an object
list (represented by commas in the RDF) will likely have duplicates subject and
predicate for those rows. Indexing the predicate will search through these
duplicates at a lower cost.

Similarly, if the RDFs contain many duplicates of different subjects, an index on
the subject column will likely benefit us as well.

Indexing the predicates will reduce the search cost. */
